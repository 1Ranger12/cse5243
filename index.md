## Description: 
This class aims to introduce the knowledge discovery process, key data mining techniques, efficient high performance mining algorithms and provide a broad based exposure to the applications of data mining. This webpage will serve as the source of information for the course. We will post all python/R, jupyter notebooks, pdfs, lecture notes and other information here. 

It is highly encouraged that you simply fork this entire repo and then just sync updates periodically. This will provide you the easiest access to all the class materials at once. For more information on this process, you can see the documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
